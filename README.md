# PI Alarm Clock

This is an alarmclock application to be run on my Raspberry Pi 4 using touchscreen.
Time is synchronized automatically with the OS.

You can configure a primary and secondary alarm source and the delay between them.
The first one is a radio channel, the second is an annoying rooster.

Radio channels,file sound location, button location and font icons are configurable in app.properties.


Other features include :

 - RSS updates
 - weather forcast
 - button color change
 - radio channel selection
 - whitenoise play
